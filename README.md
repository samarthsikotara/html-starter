## Fwd.us HTML Starter Kit

This repo contains all the resources you need to get started making projects with Fwd.us branding.

### SCSS or CSS?

You can use Compass to compile the the SCSS by running `compass compile` from this directory.

You can also just use the CSS available in the `assets/css` folder.

Foundation is available and highly recommended for building things quickly and responsively.


### Layout File

The Fwd.us header and footer are available in `layout.html`. The respective boundaries of the header and footer are commented in the file.
