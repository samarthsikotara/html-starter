## FWD.us HTML Starter Kit

This repo contains all the resources you need to get started making projects with FWD.us branding.

### SCSS or CSS?

You can use [Compass](http://compass-style.org/install/) to compile the the SCSS by running `compass compile` from this directory.

You can also just use the pre-built CSS available in the `assets/css` folder.

A [12 column grid](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/grid.html) and other pieces of the [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) framework are available and highly recommended for building things quickly and responsively.

### Layout File

The FWD.us header and footer are available in `layout.html`. The respective boundaries of the header and footer are commented in the file.
